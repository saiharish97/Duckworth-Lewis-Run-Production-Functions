# Duckworth-Lewis-Run-Production-Functions
TThe code aims to use the Duckworth-Lewis (D/L) method to compute the resources remaining in a cricket match given the overs-remaining and wickets-in-hand. The code first loads the cricket match data from a CSV file using Pandas. It then applies some cleaning to the data to include only completed games, not interrupted ones. This means the games that were played 50 overs in the first innings or less than 50 overs with 0 wickets remaining are included. The cleaned data contains 59201 rows and is then stored in a separate data frame. The code then defines the D/L model using the parameters Z0 and L (a total of 11 parameters). In the D/L system, the Z0 and L values are estimated through an optimization algorithm that minimizes the normalized sum of squared errors between the predicted and actual runs. The class DLModel contains methods to define the Z-function, compute the error function (normalized per wickets_remaining, overs, and runs), and optimize the error function to obtain the optimal values of Z0s and L subject to constraints. The class DataUtil contains utility methods to extract the match total runs and plot the graphs. The code finally plots two graphs, the average runs obtainable through the D/L method, and the resources remaining through the DL method using the optimal values of Z0s and L.
